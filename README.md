# Diabetes-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict the risk of diabetes based on health-related attributes from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. 
The goal is to analyze key health indicators, engineer meaningful features, and build an interpretable model that can help identify individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes.
